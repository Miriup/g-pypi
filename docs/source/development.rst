test_pypi
*********

This module runs numerous tests against whole PyPI. It should be run manually, 
to detect new possible issues. All failures MUST be first written as unittests
and then fixed accordingly.

.. note:: 
    
    Issues should not be closed until there are appropriate tests
    and documentation for the changeset.
